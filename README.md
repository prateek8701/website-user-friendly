In this task, you will transform an existing desktop-only webpage into a fully mobile-friendly layout using CSS media queries. You’ll begin by identifying fixed-width elements and large images that may cause layout issues on smaller screens. Then, you’ll write targeted media queries (for example, @media screen and (max-width: 768px)) to adjust the page’s structure—such as stacking columns vertically, reducing font sizes, and ensuring navigation menus adapt for mobile devices. Images should scale fluidly within their containers, and any overflow or scrolling issues must be resolved. The final deliverable will be an updated CSS file that ensures the site looks and functions properly across mobile viewports, verified using Chrome DevTools’ device toolbar.
